        <h1>4 Safety Rules When You Use These Sex Apps</h1>
        <p>
          If you are going to be using apps and sites for hookups and other adult encounters, then you’ll need to follow
          some basic sex dating rules that will help keep you safe. The following rules are the basic rules you should
          always follow, especially when you are going to be meeting someone for the first time. While you no doubt want
          to have fun, it’s more important to be safe and establish boundaries before you go any further with an
          encounter.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>Confirm their identity before agreeing to meet</h2>
            <p>
              Before you agree to meet someone you met on an app or site, you need to confirm that they are who they say
              they are—in other words, that they aren’t catfishing you or trying to scam you in some other way. You can
              confirm their identity by asking to talk to them via video chat or looking up their social media; you can
              also ask them to send a picture with a specific phrase written on a piece of paper so you can confirm that
              they aren’t using someone else’s photos.

          <li>
            <h2>Always meet in a visible, public place first
            </h2>
            <p>One of the most important sex dating rules is to always meet someone in a visible, public place first.
              This is important because it lets you establish the identity of other person you’re going to meet and get
              an overall feel of their vibe. Meeting in a visible public place gives you a chance to decide whether or
              not you want to continue with your encounter or go home.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Have a “checkup” in place
            </h2>
            <p>Another important rule designed to help keep you safe is to establish a “checkup” before you leave for
              your hookup or date. A checkup should involve either you calling/texting someone at a specific, pre-agreed
              upon time or that person calling/texting you at that time. You can then reply saying whether or not things
              are okay.
              <br>In the slim chances that something does go wrong, you need to come up with a code phrase that will
              indicate whether you need emergency services (such as in cases where you believe you may be in danger) so
              that the other party can alert the authorities.
              <br>Also, the person you’re doing a “checkup” for should know where you will be going to, who you will be
              meeting, and when you expect to be back. This information may be vital in the slim chance that something
              goes wrong.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Avoid telling strangers your home address (and exercise caution if traveling to someone else’s home)
            </h2>
            <p>If you are meeting someone for the very first time, do not give them your home address and ideally, don’t
              go to their home first either; if you need somewhere private, consider a neutral third party option such
              as a hotel. What’s most important is that you don’t reveal your home address to someone you don’t know,
              especially on a sex dating website or app.
              Remember: practice these common sense sex dating rules to keep yourself as safe as possible when going out
              for dates or hookups.
