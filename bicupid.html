            <h2>About</h2>
            <div>BiCupid is a fairly traditional dating site that caters specifically to bisexual users. The site’s
              membership is comprised of bisexual adults who are interested in finding matches of either gender for
              hookups, casual encounters, dating, and even potentially forming long-term relationships meant to last.
              BiCupid operates like a standard dating site, with the ability to create profiles, search for other
              members, and contact other members whom you think may be a good match.

            <h2>Key Features
            </h2>
            <div>
              BiCupid is a fairly traditional and almost old-school style dating site. It allows for both individual
              users and couples to sign up for the service; users can create profiles, upload photos, and even generate
              "first date ideas" which other members can browse and possibly use as a springboard for connecting with
              other users. BiCupid also features community forums so users can post a variety of topics and comments, as
              well as a blog with information about dating, the bisexual experience, and much more.
              <br>The site also has a unique "Let's Meet" feature which allows for users to approve or deny users based
              on their profile picture alone. This is a somewhat Tinder-style feature that offers a minimalistic
              alternative to the traditional way to use the site.
              <br>Free members can only browse the membership base and send "Winks." A paid membership is required for
              all other features on the site, including sending and reading messages, participating on the forums, using
              the Let’s Meet feature and more.

              (and/or bisexual threesome) connections with other adults. While free members will likely want to upgrade,
              the paid membership has enough features to make the cost worthwhile. The site has features that will
              appeal both to people looking for long term relationships as well as people hoping for more casual,
              Tinder-style connections.
