            <h2>Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>ALT is a highly niched dating site that is best for users who are specifically interested in fetish and
              alternative fantasy hookups, relationships and other forms of communications. Regular users will not
              benefit much from this site due to the fetish-oriented material. The site does offer free membership but
              users are better off springing for paid membership due to the limited options for free members in regards
              to messaging, using the community chatrooms, and more. Despite an outdated web site, ALT was—and continues
              to be—the only major source of online dating for people in the alternative community.
